<!--? Meta Title Tag: An HTML element that communicates the title of a web page to search engines-->

<!--? Meta Description Tag: An HTML element that summarizes the content of a web page for search engines -->

<!--? Meta Keyword Tag: An HTML element that communicates target keywords related to the content of a web page to search engines -->

<!--? Meta Robots Tag: An HTML element that instructs search engine bots on how to read the content of a web page -->

<!--? Proper Heading Tags: -->
<!-- Use hierarchical heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) to structure your content. Place your main target keyword in the <h1> tag for the page title and use other headings to organize content logically. -->

<!--? Image Optimization: -->
<!--? Include the alt attribute for every <img> tag to provide alternative text for images. Use descriptive text that conveys the image's purpose or content. 
Also, use Webp format to make your image size smaller, faster to load and much more. -->

<!--? Robots Meta Tag: -->

<!-- Use the <meta> tag with the robots attribute to control search engine indexing and following of links on specific pages. -->

<!-- <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"> -->

<!--? noindex: This tells search engines not to include the page in their search results. So, if someone searches for keywords related to the content on that page, it won't appear in the search results. -->

<!-- nofollow: This tells search engines not to follow any links on the page. Even if the page contains links to other pages, those links won't be followed or considered for indexing. -->

<!-- This meta tag is commonly used for pages that you don't want to be publicly accessible or indexed by search engines. Some examples include login pages, admin sections, or pages with sensitive information. -->

<!--* BONUS  -->
<!--? <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->
<!-- While the <meta name="viewport"> tag itself is not directly related to SEO (Search Engine Optimization), it indirectly impacts SEO by ensuring that your website is mobile-friendly and provides a good user experience on various devices. -->
